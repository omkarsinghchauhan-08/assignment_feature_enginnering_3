    "# 6. Scree Plot: Plot the eigenvalues against the principal components. This is called a scree plot. It can help you visually identify an \"elbow point\" where the eigenvalues start to level off. This point can be used as a heuristic to decide how many principal components to retain.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. Threshold: Choose a threshold for the amount of variance you want to retain. This threshold is often determined based on the problem at hand. For example, you might aim to retain 95% or 99% of the total variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 8. Decision: Based on the cumulative explained variance and the scree plot, and considering your chosen threshold, decide how many principal components to retain. You want to retain enough components to reach your desired level of variance while also keeping the dimensionality reduction reasonable.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Keep in mind that the number of retained principal components can vary depending on the characteristics of your data and the specific goals of your analysis. Generally, you want to retain enough principal components to capture the significant patterns and variability in your data while reducing dimensionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In practice, you might start with a larger number of components and gradually decrease it while monitoring the cumulative explained variance. The specific number of principal components you ultimately choose to retain should align with the goals of your analysis and the needs of the downstream tasks, such as modeling or classification."
